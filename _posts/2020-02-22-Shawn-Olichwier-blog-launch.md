Blog is finally happening! This will be a training grounds, learning experience, and diary for many of my data science tasks. Practice is the only way to get better at a task. Hopefully in the process of creating the entries I will become more skilled at data analysis, programming, and writing. The journey begins today!

The first task to tackle is data visualization. I find that it is an area in my studies that was missing. I have limited experience with MatPlotLib but that is not substantial enough to be considered a great data scientist. Coincidentally, some of the work at my internship with Lockheed Martin has prepared me for this area. My job, thus far, has been mainly front-end app development with the Python library Dash. Dash is an interactive visualization tool. It is programmed in Python with only a minor amount of HTML or CSS knowledge. I will cover all of that in due time, do not worry. 

All data tells a story. Data Visualization techniques are essential for a great data scientist to be able to tell the story to others. I begin my journey here so I can start my story and create great looking apps while we I do it. Hopefully you learn something from these post. Do not hesitate to comment or contact me. I am always looking to increase our knowledge of all things. The only way to learn is to fail. With that, let's begin!

- All the best,
Shawn
